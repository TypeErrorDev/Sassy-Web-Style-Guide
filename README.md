# Web-Style-Guide
 
Well hello again!

This project really kicked my butt! Oh maannnnn. So much struggle, but in the end, I accomplished something that I would have NEVER been able to do not even 35 days ago. This goes to show that if you continue to believe in yourself, put in the time and dedication, that you will be able to push yourself past your known limits and becom successful in life.

This project is a Web Style Guide utilizing scss to compile the css stylesheet. 

As you can see from the TODO list, I struggled a bit on some of the tasks, but once I started to break the task down methodically I was able to start making progress. 

Hope you enjoy the project and there are more like this coming up! Stay tuned!
